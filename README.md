# Sales_Analysis

It's the end of the year and time to analyze if the business has lived up to its sales forecast implemented at the beginning of the year. A sales forecast is an essential tool for managing a business of any size. It is a month-by-month forecast of the level of sales you expect to achieve. Most businesses draw up a sales forecast once a year.

With that said, in this project, I will be analyzing the business's yearly sales activities and determine factors such as:

 1.Highest sales turnover, 

 2.Highest sales per city, 

 3.Highest sales per month, 

 4.The product most sold, 

 5.Best time to place advisement.
 
# Objetive
The main objective is to see if the business has lived up to its sales forecast, and find areas to propose improvements.

# Dataset
Dataset consists of 12 month wealth of sales data [Jan-Dec]. Analysis can be done for a single file, and all dataset has been combined into a single file to allow analysis for the whole year.
